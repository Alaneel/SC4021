If you introduce more than one, perform an ablation study to show the contribution of each innovation. For example, if you perform WSD and NER to enhance sentiment analysis, show the increase in accuracy when adding only WSD, the increase in accuracy when adding only NER, and the increase in accuracy when adding both WSD and NER to your system. Explain why they are important to solve specific problems, illustrated with examples. Possible innovations include (but are not limited to) the following:
• Enhanced classification (add another NLU subtask, e.g., sarcasm detection)
• Fine-grained classification (e.g., perform ABSA)
• Hybrid classification (e.g., apply both symbolic and subsymbolic AI)
• Cognitive classification (e.g., use brain-inspired algorithms)
• Multitask classification (e.g., perform two or more NLU tasks jointly)
• Ensemble classification (e.g., use stacked ensemble)
