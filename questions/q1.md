# Question 1.1 Answer

We implemented a comprehensive data collection system targeting streaming service opinions from two primary platforms: Reddit and Twitter. Our approach employed a modular architecture featuring specialized crawlers for each source.

## Reddit Data Collection

For Reddit data collection, we leveraged the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to access Reddit's API. We focused on ten streaming-related subreddits including r/Netflix, r/DisneyPlus, r/Hulu, r/PrimeVideo, r/cordcutters, r/StreamingBestOf, r/HBOMax, r/appletv, r/peacock, and r/paramountplus. Our crawler (the `RedditCrawler` class in `crawler/crawler.py`) collected both submissions and comments, implementing several filtering mechanisms:

- Content length filtering (minimum 20 characters) to ensure meaningful content  
- Pagination handling with a configurable post limit  
- Metadata extraction including author, creation time, score, and subreddit information  
- Comment depth limitation for processing efficiency  
- Automatic platform detection using keyword matching  

## Twitter Data Collection (Not activated due to quota issues)

For Twitter data, we implemented a `TwitterCrawler` class using the Tweepy library. The crawler performs searches with carefully crafted queries that combine streaming service names with opinion-related terms such as "review", "opinion", and "thoughts." To maintain data quality, we:

- Filtered non-English tweets  
- Excluded retweets to focus on original content  
- Implemented rate limiting to respect Twitter API constraints  
- Applied the same platform detection logic used for Reddit content  

All collected data was stored in CSV format with a unified schema for consistent downstream processing. The raw data was saved in separate files (`reddit_streaming_data.csv` and `twitter_streaming_data.csv`), then combined into a unified dataset (`streaming_opinions_dataset.csv`) using our `combine_datasets` function. The storage process included:

- Assigning unique IDs to each record with source prefixing (e.g., `reddit_` or `twitter_`)  
- Normalizing date formats across sources  
- Preserving source-specific fields while maintaining a consistent core schema  
- Implementing duplicate detection and removal
