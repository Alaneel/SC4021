### Justify your classification approach choice in relation to the state of the art
* Discuss whether you had to preprocess data and why
* Build an evaluation dataset by manually labeling at least 1,000 records with an inter-annotator agreement of at least 80%
* Provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure on such dataset
* Perform a random accuracy test on the rest of the data and discuss results
* Discuss performance metrics, e.g., speed, and scalability of the system
